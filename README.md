## My Portfolio Website

Hello there! My name is Isabel Sopha and I am a Software Developer. Welcome to my portfolio website where I showcase my projects and work history.

## **About Me**

I started my journey in software development by learning JavaScript in 2022. I have worked on various projects that have helped me hone my skills in problem-solving, debugging, coding, etc. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks to improve my knowledge and add more value to my work.

In addition to my technical skills, I also possess excellent communication and teamwork skills, which I've developed through working on team projects and collaborating with others. I believe that effective communication is key to delivering successful software projects, and I always strive to maintain open communication channels with my team and stakeholders.

I'm excited about the future of software development and the endless possibilities it presents. If you're looking for a dedicated software developer who is passionate about their work and always eager to learn, I would love to connect with you!
